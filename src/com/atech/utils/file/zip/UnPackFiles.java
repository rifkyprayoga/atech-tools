/*
 * UNPACKING ZIP FILES
 * 
 * Zip files are used widely for packaging and distributing software. ZipFile is
 * a handy tool for doing the following: reading the contents of .zip and .jar
 * files, obtaining a list of the files they contain, and reading the contents
 * of individual files. Jar files, used in Java software distribution, employ
 * the Zip file format as well. For more information on Jar files, see JDC Tech
 * Tips No. 1 (September 3, 1997) at the following address:
 * 
 * http://developer.javasoft.com/developer/technicalArticles/TechTips/
 * 
 * java.util.ZipFile is a class used to represent a Zip file. You construct a
 * ZipFile object, and then iterate over the entries in the file, each of which
 * is a ZipEntry. Entries can be checked to determine if they are directories
 * and read from as if they were individual files, in addition to other
 * functions. The ZipFile class is found in both JDK 1.1 and JDK 1.2 beta2.
 * 
 * Here is an example of using ZipFile to dump out the entries and contents of a
 * .zip file. The program accepts a single file argument, along with an optional
 * -contents flag that indicates the contents should also be displayed (note
 * that printing a binary file to screen does not work well).
 * 
 * 
 * This program includes a workaround for a bug in JDK versions 1.1 and 1.2 beta
 * 2, that is, bug #4040920 in the JDC Bug Parade database. Normally, when you
 * read from a low-level file input stream, you read chunks of, say, 1024 bytes
 * at a time, and you don't worry whether that many bytes are actually left to
 * read. This approach fails with the input stream returned by getInputStream
 * for a given Zip file entry, and the workaround is to never try to read more
 * bytes from the entry than are actually there.
