To compile all the .java files to .class files, simply do:

	% make all

This will also generate a JAR (Java archive) file containing all the
classes.  Copy all the .class files, the .jar file and the .vnc files to an
installation directory (e.g. /usr/local/vnc/classes):

	% cp *.class *.jar *.vnc /usr/local/vnc/classes

Make sure that the vncserver script is configured to point to the
installation directory.
