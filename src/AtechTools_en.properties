#  Please use this file as default language file. Do not try to translate 
#  from any other files, since this is the Master language file. Create the
#  same header and specify application version number for easier changes at 
#  later time.
#  Translations should be grouped by groupes as specified here. 
#  Older groups are done by packages, newer by logical name.

#
#  NOTE: If you application uses some dialogs, you will have to copy whole group 
#     to your applications language file. Exceptions to this are various tools
#     that are part of atech tools package.
